    <p>Uh oh! Something went wrong?</p>
    <p>Did you definitely upload a .ics file like you were meant to?</p>
    <p>If you did, then there's already a timetable named {{name}},</p>
    <p>so you'll have to rename {{name}} to something different.</p>
    <p>One more thing that may have gone wrong...</p>
    <p>If you were on the redrict page, and you were typing the name of your timetable</p>
    <p>Then evidently you typed it wrong, and that file doesn't exist!</p>
